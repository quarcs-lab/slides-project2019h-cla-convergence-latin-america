## Motivation:

- Economic convergence is important for regional cohesion and competitiveness

- Inconclusive literature about Latin America: Convergence vs Divergence vs Convergence Clubs (Galvao and Reis-Gomes, 2007; Barrios et. al, 2018; Martin and Vazquez, 2015)

- Development potential of Latin America constrained  by low productivity (Daude and Fernndez-Arias, 2010; Pages 2010; Restuccia, 2013)

  
## Research Objective:
  
- (Re)evaluate the convergence hypothesis across economies in Latin America with particular emphasis on productivity differences and the formation of multiple convergence clubs. 

  
## Methods:

- Nonlinear dynamic factor model  (Phillips and Sul, 2007, 2009)

- Clustering algorithm for panel data (Phillips and Sul, 2007, 2009)

## Data:

- Labor productivity and total factor productivity (Fernandez-Arias, 2017)

- 20 Latin American countries over the 1980-2014 period

## Main Results:

1. **Lack of overall convergence** in both labor productivity and total factor productivity

2. Regional heterogeneity matters: **Multiple local convergence clubs**

3. **Covergence clubs characteristics:** 

  - Labor productivity: **Four clubs** of countries
  - Total factor productivity: **Three clubs** of countries
  - The lowest-productivity club (Honduras and Nicaragua) is diverging from the rest **at the highest speed**.

**Implication**: Pockets of heterogeneity (convergence clubs) need to be addressed to improve economic cohesion and competitiveness in Latin America.

# Outline of this presentation

1. **Global convergence "on average":** Using classical summary measures

  - Beta convergence
  - Sigma convergence

2. **Let's go beyond the average:** Regional heterogeneity still matters

  - Distribution dynamics framework
  - Distributional convergence

3. **Local convergence clusters:**

  - Overall efficiency: Two convergence clusters
  - Pure technical efficiency: Two convergence clusters
  - Scale efficiency: One convergence cluster

# Regional heterogeneity matters

- Let's GO beyond the average! 

- Study the dynamics of the **entire regional distribution**

    - Let's move from **conditional mean** to **conditional density** estimation.
    - Recent advances in nonparametric econometrics: **Distribution dynamics**

# Concluding Remarks

## A happy ending "on average" :

- Differences in overall efficiency and its two determinants (pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency) have decreased over the 1990-2010 period. 

- Global convergence on average

## Focus beyond the average :

- Regional differences are still important

- Multiple local convergence clubs:
  - Overall efficiency: Two convergence clusters
  - Pure technical efficiency: Two convergence clusters
  - Scale efficiency: One convergence cluster

## Implications and further research

- Convergence clusters help us identify regions facing similar challenges
- Call for better coordination of regional policies at the cluster level
- What is the role of geographical neighbors in accelerating  convergence?
- What alternative clustering frameworks could be implemented?
